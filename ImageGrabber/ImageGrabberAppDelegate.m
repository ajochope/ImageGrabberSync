 @synthesize window=_window;
 
 The backing variable for window will be called _window
 
 This allows you to decouple the name of the property 
 from the name of your variable. 
 In fact, if you don't use @synthesize you don't need to have a backing variable at all.
 Everyone has different reasons, this is one:
 
 To avoid clashes with variable names 
 and make it clear when I'm using a local variable
 and when I'm using an instance variable.
